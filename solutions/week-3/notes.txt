Notes for week-3:

I should compare the double-grover and permutation matrix methods. Still don't get the permutation matrix method though.

lines 32-36:

def mini_counter(qc, qr):
    qc.ccx(qr[0], qr[1], qr[2])
    qc.cx(qr[0], qr[1])

def reverse_mini_counter(qc, qr):
    qc.cx(qr[0], qr[1])
    qc.ccx(qr[0], qr[1], qr[2])
